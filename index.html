        <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing">Boxing</a> is a sport that combines <strong>physical skill, strategy, and mental toughness</strong>, often referred to as 
            <strong>"the sweet science."</strong> It involves two fighters competing in a ring, using punches, defensive movements, and footwork to outscore or knock out their opponent. 
            Beyond its competitive nature, boxing is also a discipline that <strong>builds endurance, strength, and self control,</strong> requiring rigorous training and dedication.
